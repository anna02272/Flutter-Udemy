### Roll Dice App: 
The Roll Dice App is a simple Flutter application designed to teach fundamental concepts of Flutter and Dart programming. With a tap of a button, users can roll virtual dice, which generates a random number each time.
This app serves as an excellent hands-on learning tool, covering a wide range of topics including widget creation, function implementation, variable manipulation, and even state management with stateful widgets.
